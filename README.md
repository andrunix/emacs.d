# Emacs!

This is my personal emacs config. And it's always changing and probably a mess.
But I'm always refining it. This one owes quite a bit to Mark Feller's config

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/andrunix/emacs.d.git ~/emacs.d
```

I'll be following up with a nice segregation like Mark's but for now,
I'm breaking this out of my 'dotfiles' repo into it's own.
